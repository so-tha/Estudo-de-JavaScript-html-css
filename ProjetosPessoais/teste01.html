    <h1>
        Twistinâ€™ the Night Away
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Sam Cooke
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        Let me tell you 'bout a place
Somewhere up-a New York way
<br>
Where the people are so gay
<br>
Twistin' the night away
<br>
Here they have a lot of fun
<br>
Puttin' trouble on the run
<br>
Man, you find the old and young
<br>
Twistin' the night away
<br>
<br>
They're twistin', twistin'
<br>
Everybody's feelin' great
<br>
They're twistin', twistin'
<br>
They're twistin' the night away
<br>
<br>
Here's a man in evening clothes
<br>
How he got here, I don't know, but
<br>
Man, you oughta see him go
<br>
Twistin' the night away
<br>
He's dancin' with a chick in slacks
<br>
She's movin' up and back
<br>
Oh, man, there ain't nothin' like
<br>
<br>
Twistin' the night away
<br>
They're twistin', twistin'
<br>
Everybody's feelin' great
<br>
They're twistin', twistin'
<br>
They're twistin' the night
<br>
<br>
Let's twist a while
<br>
Lean up
<br>
Lean back
<br>
Lean up
<br>
Lean back
<br>
Watusi
<br>
Now fly
<br>
Now twist
<br>
<br>
They're twistin' the night away
<br>
<br>
Here's a fella in blue jeans
<br>
Dancin' with an older queen
<br>
Who's dolled up in her diamond rings and
<br>
Twistin' the night away
<br>
Man, you oughta see her go
<br>
Twistin' to the rock and roll
<br>
Here you find the young and old
<br>
<br>
Twistin' the night away
<br>
They're twistin', twistin', man
<br>
Everybody's feelin' great
<br>
They're twistin', twistin'
<br>
They're twistin' the night
<br>
<br>
One more time
<br>
Lean up
<br>
Lean back
<br>
Lean up
<br>
Lean back
<br>
Watusi
<br>
Now fly
<br>
Now twist
<br>
<br>
<br>
